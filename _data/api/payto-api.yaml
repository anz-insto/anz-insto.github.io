      summary: Create a new mandate.
      description: "The purpose of this operation is to create a new mandate in the MMS. A mandate is always created by the Payment Initiator. If the Establishment Scheme for the mandate is 'AUPM' then the mandate will be created bilaterally, otherwise it will be created unilaterally. A unilaterally created mandate will have initial status 'Active' and version '1' whereas a bilaterally created mandate will have initial status 'Created' and version '0'. A bilaterally created mandate can only become 'Active' when the Debtor confirms the creation of the mandate, at which moment its' version will also increase to '1'. \n\nA bilateral mandate creation will automatically expire after a fixed time period if the creation action is not completed, declined or recalled. Expiry of a mandate creation will result in the mandate status being set to 'Cancelled'. \n\nThe initial API response indicates if ANZ has accepted or rejected the request, not the processing outcome of the request. The processing outcome of the request will be delivered via the **PayTo Webhook API**"
