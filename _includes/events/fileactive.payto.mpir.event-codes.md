### PayTo MPIR Event Codes

Validation failures relating to MPIR submissions. 

The transaction status and transaction reason codes are returned in the [PayTo API Webhook MPIR Processing Outcome]({{ site.baseurl }}/fileactive/api/payto-api-webhook).

Transaction reason codes can be generated by both ANZ and the other finiancial institution (OFI) involved in processing the MPIR. Where ANZ is also the debtor then ANZ can generate the "OFI" transaction reason codes below.
